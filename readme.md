# Game and API services.

This project is a set of services for games and api, built with JavaScript and Node.js.

#### Note on TypeScript. ####

Simplicity is key. I enjoy the freedom of being able to run my code without the need for compilation steps. Plus, I wish to work closer to the core of JavaScript. It allows me to dive deeper into the language and learn more along the way.

## Project Requirements

- JavaScript and Node.js: The code is implemented using JavaScript and runs on Node.js.

- JSDoc Comments: The code is commented using JSDoc syntax to provide documentation for functions and objects.

- ES6 Modules: The code uses ES6 module syntax for importing and exporting modules.

## Project Structure

The project consists of Core module and service examples to build from:

1. Core module.
   Where the important core logic lives, made to just be the minimum to start up a service. and utils that would fit all or most services.

2. Gateway service:
   A service for auth...

3. Game service:
   Where one will implement your gamelogic, it's made to be multiple instances, for example, one per zone or to handle too many players on one server.

4. Lobby service:
   Made to be one of per game, or one of per region. which can queue players to multiple game services.

5. Monitor Service:
   A hub to collect errors and other information from the servers.

6. TEMPLATESERVICE:
   A template service where most things are ready to be used.
