# Game Server & Matchmaking service

This project is a matchmaking service built with JavaScript and Node.js. It provides functionality for matching players based on various criteria. The service follows the requirements listed below:

#### Note on TypeScript. ####

Simplicity is key. I enjoy the freedom of being able to run my code without the need for compilation steps. Plus, I wish to work closer to the core of JavaScript. It allows me to dive deeper into the language and learn more along the way.

## Project Requirements

- JavaScript and Node.js: The code is implemented using JavaScript and runs on Node.js.

- JSDoc Comments: The code is commented using JSDoc syntax to provide documentation for functions and objects.

- ES6 Modules: The code uses ES6 module syntax for importing and exporting modules.

## Project Structure

The project consists of 2 examples to build from:

1. Gameserver:
   Where one will implement your gamelogic, it's made to be multiple instances, for example, one per zone or to handle too many players on one server.

3. Matchmaking:
   Made to be one of per game, or one of per region. which can queue players to multiple gameservers.

5. Comming, ServiceMonitor.
   A hub to collect errors and other information from the servers.
